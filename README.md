# ZOOM PHP SDK
The Zoom API allows developers to safely and securely access information from Zoom. You can use this API to build private services or public applications on the [Zoom App Marketplace](http://marketplace.zoom.us). To learn how to get your credentials and create private/public applications, read our [Authorization Guide](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/authorization/credentials). All endpoints are available via `https` and are located at `api.zoom.us/v2/`.  For instance you can list all users on an account via `https://api.zoom.us/v2/users/`.

This PHP package is automatically generated by the [Swagger Codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project:

- API version: 2.0.0
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.PhpClientCodegen

## Requirements

PHP 7.2 and later

## Installation & Usage

```php
$apiKey = "[YOUR_API_KEY]";
$apiSecret = "[YOUR_API_SECRET]";

$payload = array(
    "iss" => $apiKey,
    // How much time the jtw token should last
    "exp" => (int) (new DateTime())->add(new DateInterval('PT60M'))->format('U'),
);

// This is the JWT token. It will last for the time you expressed above.
// We suggest you cache it for the same duration, to avoid generating a new one each time
$jwt = \Firebase\JWT\JWT::encode($payload, $apiSecret);

$this->config = \Weble\Zoom\Configuration::getDefaultConfiguration()->setAccessToken($jwt);
$apiInstance = new \Weble\Zoom\Api\UsersApi(
    new \GuzzleHttp\Client(),
    $config
);
